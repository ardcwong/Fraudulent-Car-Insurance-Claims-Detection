# Fraudulent Car Insurance Claims Detection

## Overview

Welcome to the **DSFC13-DATASQU4D** repository, which showcases the work of the **DataSqu4d** team from **Eskwelabs Data Science Fellowship Cohort 13**. This project focuses on solving real-world problems using data science techniques and methodologies, aligning with Eskwelabs' vision of empowering students to apply data science in impactful ways.

### Key Project: Fraudulent Car Insurance Claims Detection

One of the primary outcomes of this project is the creation of a **predictive model to detect fraudulent car insurance claims**, addressing the challenges of working with unbalanced data. The model helps identify fraudulent claims more effectively, providing valuable insights for insurance companies.
