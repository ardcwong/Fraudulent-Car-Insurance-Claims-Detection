# Fraudulent Car Insurance Claims Detection

## Overview

Welcome to the **DSFC13-DATASQU4D** repository, which showcases the work of the **DataSqu4d** team from **Eskwelabs Data Science Fellowship Cohort 13**. This project focuses on solving real-world problems using data science techniques and methodologies, aligning with Eskwelabs' vision of empowering students to apply data science in impactful ways. One of the primary outcomes of this project is the creation of a **predictive model to detect fraudulent car insurance claims**, addressing the challenges of working with unbalanced data. The model helps identify fraudulent claims more effectively, providing valuable insights for insurance companies.
